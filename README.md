<h1>Banking System Application</h1>

<p>The Banking System Application is a Java-based project that simulates a basic banking system. It provides functionality to create accounts, perform transactions, and manage funds.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Console App:</strong> The project includes a console-based application that allows users to interact with the banking system through a command-line interface. It supports commands for creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, transferring money between accounts, and viewing account details.</li>
  <li><strong>Graphical User Interface:</strong> Additionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) version of the application is provided, which offers a more user-friendly experience. The GUI version allows users to perform the same operations as the console app but with the convenience of buttons and input fields.</li>
  <li><strong>Modular Architecture:</strong> The project follows a modular architecture, separating different functionalities into individual classes. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.</li>
  <li><strong>Persistent Data Storage:</strong> The banking system implements a simple mechanism to store account data persistently without using a database. Account information is stored in memory and preserved across application runs.</li>
</ul>
